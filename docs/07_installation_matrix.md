## Dependencies discussed but not included in default scaffold
| Dependency | Reason not in default scaffold |
|---|---|
| OpenTelemetry Operator 0.148.0 | requires extra Kubernetes components such as cert-manager; documented as optional extension |
| FastAPI | useful for HTTP API, but CLI + MCP are enough for MVP |
| Ray | useful for distributed AI compute, but too large a dependency jump for compiler-first MVP |
| KServe | strong inference serving option, but this repo is not an inference-serving platform |
| Temporal / Flyte / Dagster | heavier or less transcript-aligned than the selected K3s + Argo path |

## GPU note
This scaffold does **not** force-install CUDA or PyTorch. GPU support is modeled as a **resource class**, optional scheduling preference, and optional execution path, because:
- the transcript mentions heterogeneous accelerators configurable per application,
- but exact onboard accelerator interfaces are not public here,
- and CUDA / driver / kernel compatibility must be validated per target node.

Use CPU-first development, then layer GPU execution into specific workflow steps after node-level validation.
